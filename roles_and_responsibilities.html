            <li>Lead the team on and off the field.</li>
            <li>Communicate match schedules and updates to team members in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Prepare the roster of registered players for their respective teams before the start of the season.</li>
            <li>Finalise the team together with the other club team counterpart before Tuesday and communicate it with players. If for any reason, both counterparts are not able to decide on the team, call all the club administrators (all the roles listed here apart from player) meeting on Wednesday. The group will then decide the team together.</li>
            <li>Communicate match day’s strategies and player’s role before Thursday for Saturday's match.</li>
            <li>Foster team spirit and maintain discipline.</li>
            <li>Communicate with the opposition captain and fulfil all the match day’s duties as per the League’s guidelines.</li>
            <li>Make sure every match’s scoreboard is updated accurately on the club/league website.</li>

            <li> Setup a “Performance Review” meeting with the entire club administration if the team’s league points(including losing draw points) are less than 45% after any 7 played matches (with a result, i.e. not including washed off or walkover matches). The club administration team, will then look at all the factors such as team morale, team performance, competition level etc and come up with a “Performance Improvement Plan”(PIP) for the captain to help him meet the target of achieving the target of 45% league points in the next 5 matches (with a result). The club administration will extend all the help necessary to the captain to achieve his target including but not limited to providing the captain in PIP with most of his preferred team players after an agreement with his counterpart. However, in case the performance review uncovers the root cause of the team’s performance to be favouritism during the team selection or inadequate use of the skill sets of the selected team players, the club administration team may decide to take over the process of team selection from the captain or/and suggest/enforce role changes for the team members. In the case of repeated performance target not being met by the captain AND a decreasing team morale as a result of it, the club administration team may ask the team captain to resign. Post which club administration team will select the next captain. All the players that have played at least 15 league matches with LSK OR have played more than 75% of matches during any past completed league would be considered by the administration team for the post of captain.</li>
